# Super Crazy Soccer Pong

This is an attempt to create a video game based on the classic Pong gameplay.

It's using pure HTML5 technologies, as well as pure reactive functionnal javascript (using Cycle.js).

## Installation

Make sure you have installed nodejs and run:

```bash
$ npm install
```

You may now build the assets using the following command:

```bash
$ gulp
```

Last steps consists to open the index.html using your favourite webserver. For example, with php installed, you might do:

```bash
$ php -S localhost:8081
```

and open http://localhost:8081 in your favourite browser.
